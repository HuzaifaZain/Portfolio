# Business Quaries
## 🔹 SECTION 1: Core Lookup & Data Integration Problems (1–10)
### 1. Order Revenue Calculation

For each row in order_details, calculate the total revenue by fetching the pizza price from the pizzas table using pizza_id and multiplying it by quantity.

👉 Requires: VLOOKUP / XLOOKUP



2. Pizza Name Mapping

Add a new column in order_details that displays the pizza name, by linking pizza_id → pizza_type_id → name.

👉 Requires: Nested lookups or INDEX + MATCH

3. Category Identification

Determine the category (Classic, Chicken, Supreme, Veggie) for every pizza ordered.

👉 Requires: Two-step lookup across three tables

4. Order Date Attribution

Bring the order date from the orders table into order_details using order_id.

👉 Requires: XLOOKUP or INDEX-MATCH

5. Order Time Attribution

Fetch the order time for each pizza sold and store it in order_details.

👉 Business Use: Peak-hour analysis

6. Pizza Size Description

Using pizza_id, extract and display the pizza size (S, M, L, XL, XXL).

👉 Requires: Lookup on composite keys

7. Price Band Classification

Classify pizzas into Low / Medium / Premium price bands using price fetched from pizzas.

👉 Requires: Lookup + conditional logic

8. Ingredient List Retrieval

Fetch the ingredient list for each pizza ordered from pizza_types.

👉 Business Use: Supply chain & inventory forecasting

9. Revenue per Pizza Line

Calculate line-level revenue and validate it by dynamically fetching prices.

👉 Requires: Lookup embedded inside arithmetic formula

10. Missing Pizza Validation

Identify if any pizza_id exists in order_details but not in the pizzas table.

👉 Requires: XLOOKUP with error handling

## 🔹 SECTION 2: Advanced Analytical Lookups (11–20)
11. Daily Sales Calculation

For each order date, calculate total sales using lookup-based revenue mapping.

👉 Requires: Lookups + aggregation

12. Category-Wise Revenue

Calculate total revenue generated by each pizza category.

👉 Requires: Lookup → category → aggregation

13. Top-Selling Pizza Identification

Determine the pizza name with the highest quantity sold.

👉 Requires: INDEX-MATCH with MAX logic

14. Highest Revenue Pizza

Identify the pizza that generated the maximum total revenue.

👉 Requires: Dynamic lookup + ranking logic

15. Peak Order Hour

Extract the hour from order time and identify which hour generated the highest revenue.

👉 Requires: Time lookup + transformation

16. Order Value Calculation

Calculate total order value per order_id by summing all related pizza revenues.

👉 Requires: Lookup-driven consolidation

17. Pizza Category Share (%)

Calculate the percentage contribution of each category to total revenue.

👉 Requires: Lookup + percentage logic

18. Most Ingredient-Heavy Pizza

Determine which pizza has the maximum number of ingredients.

👉 Requires: Lookup + text processing

19. Size-Wise Revenue Analysis

Calculate total revenue for each pizza size (S, M, L, XL, XXL).

👉 Requires: Size lookup + aggregation

20. Low-Performing Pizzas

Identify pizzas whose total sales revenue is below the overall average.

👉 Requires: INDEX-MATCH + conditional comparison

## 🔹 SECTION 3: Expert-Level & Portfolio-Showcase Problems (21–30)
21. Dynamic Menu Pricing Table

Create a dynamic price matrix where rows are pizza names and columns are sizes.

👉 Requires: INDEX + MATCH + HLOOKUP

22. Order Profitability Flag

Flag orders as High / Medium / Low value based on total order revenue.

👉 Requires: Multi-step lookup logic

23. Ingredient Demand Estimation

Estimate how often each ingredient is used based on pizza sales volume.

👉 Requires: Lookup + text parsing + multiplication

24. Category Peak Time Analysis

Identify which category sells most during lunch vs dinner hours.

👉 Requires: Time + category lookups

25. Duplicate Order Detection

Detect if any order_id appears more than once in orders.

👉 Requires: Lookup-based validation

26. Missing Order Details Check

Identify orders that exist in orders but have no corresponding entries in order_details.

👉 Requires: Anti-lookup logic

27. Dynamic Pizza Lookup Tool

Build a drop-down pizza selector that displays price, size, category, and ingredients.

👉 Requires: XLOOKUP with dynamic references

28. Menu Optimization Insight

Identify pizzas that sell high quantity but generate low revenue.

👉 Requires: Quantity + revenue comparison via lookup

29. Average Order Size by Category

Calculate the average number of pizzas per order for each category.

👉 Requires: Multi-table lookup logic
